SimpleSocialAppPrototype
simple app prototype has 2 screens. First screen show you profile's image, name and rating, in my instance it's photo of actor who played Doctor who, his number of regeneration. On first screen you can, also, tap on "like" or "skip" button or swipe right and left. If you tap "like" or swipe right, doctors rating increased on 1 point and you go to another doctor's profile. If you tap "skip" or swipe left, rating stays the same and you see next profile. if you tap on doctor's photo you will go to the second screen. It is a table view which consists all doctor's profiles with photo, name and rating(rating changes related with the results of your actions on first screen).
